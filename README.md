# Twitter Terminal
#### This is a way to tweet from a GroupMe group chat.
## Why?
Suppose you have a shared Twitter account for an organization. As the leadership within the organization changes, you do not have to keep track of who has the password to the account and no longer have to worry about sharing credentials. Simply add the members that are allowed to tweet to a group chat. It can also be helpful for a group of organizers to tweet updates about an event and throughout an event.
## Commands:
"@bot#tweet: &lt;insert text here&gt;" This will tweet the text.  
"@bot#pic: &lt;word&gt; Will check if there is a r/<word> subreddit, pick a random picture from 150 of the hot posts and tweet the picture.   Example: "@bot#pic: cat" will tweet a picture of a cat pulled from reddit.com/r/cat
